This project folder contains the same code as 11_* project but modified for evading AV using yara.
The command: yara64.exe <yara_index.yar_location> <.exe_name>
is used to find the string that matches with the present yararules.
Using yara's output we can find which strings are responsible for the AV to flag the .exe file as malicious and perform repetitive iteration over the malicious code as much as possible to evade yararules from passing any conditions which ultimately leads to AV evasion
