This module makes use of base64 encoding the shellcode
The file notepad.bin (same as notepad.ico from the previous module but extension changed) contains the shellcode for opening notepad.exe

So we need to encode it in base64 using the following command:
> certutil -encode notepad.bin notepad.b64

In return it gives the base64 encoded output file(notepad.b64)
Now copy the base64 encoding (excluding the header and footer) in the array base64_payload[] present in the .cpp file
Finally perform the other steps that is present in the README.md file
